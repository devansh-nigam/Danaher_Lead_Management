Bulit Under  "CorpComp Challenge" for TechFest 20-21

The app is deployed on Google Firebase. A separate business email id : danaherlead@gmail.com has been made to manage the server operations at Firebase. It has been made, keeping in mind that this project will be transferred to Danaher Corporation.

### âœ” Description  of the problem
All big business corporations must have faced this problem where they don't have a centralized system of forwarding leads withing their business associates. This app is specifically made for the well-known Danaher Global Corporation keeping in mind the gravity of this problem.

### âœ”  And Here's the solution for the above stated problem
**Danaher Lead** enables transfers of lead within the system very quickly, with just few touch on your moblie screen and you have submitted a valuable asset to your organisation. Though, some features are yet to be implemented, I think that this is a very amazing start for the app.

### âœ”  So here's how it actually works ðŸ“±:
- The Employee creates his/her account on the **Moblie App** with all the required details (email and company included)
- Then he adds the leads manually ( with all the necessary info )
- If he has any assigned leads, it appears in real-time on the dashboard
- All the leads, when submitted have default status of Open
- A lead with Open status can be marked either Validated or Rejected the first time
- Only Validated Leads can be marked as closed afterwards
- Timestamp of each status change is captured and updated henceforth
- A user can filter through the assigned/submitted leads by the use of check boxes

- XML 
- Firebase Firestore Recycler

#### Back End  ( Hosted on Google Firebase ):

- Care has been taken so that no one can bypass the authenication easily. 
- Also, Users's Segment and Exact company is taken as a input by the help of a spinner instead of a text field to increase security.
