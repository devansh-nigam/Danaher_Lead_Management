##### âœ” Description  of the problem
 We all students have faced the time when we missed one or two classes due to which we are not able to cope-up with what's going on in the class. Moreover these backlogs keeps getting added and when the D-day (exams) comes we find ourselves in a miserable situation where we know the syllabus but we are actuallly wasting most of our valuable time watching number of youtube videos to understand a simple topic or calling the freind who promised to teach that topic at the end but not picking up ðŸ˜’.
### âœ”  And Here's the solution for everything stated above 
**UNIV** enables "peer to peeer teaching" which in short means that any student can teach one or many students through  **Google Meet** while being moderated by the institute in exchange of **credits** which  could be redeemed as and when he wants in college campus food stalls or during college fests . Adding to this  a student can create online discussion grps where a number of students can join , discuss topic among themselves or with a teacher and get there doubts clear anytime. Any student can upload his notes  in exchange of credit when a student saves that "Note" . So , all in all this hack enables and motivates the student to help other students :)

### âœ”  So here's how it actually works ðŸ“±:
- The Employee creates his/her account on the **Moblie App** with all the required details (email and company included)
- Then he adds the leads manually ( with all the necessary info )
- If he has any assigned leads, it appears in real-time on the dashboard
- All the leads, when submitted have default status of Open
- A lead with Open status can be marked either Validated or Rejected the first time
- Only Validated Leads can be marked as closed afterwards
- Timestamp of each status change is captured and updated henceforth
- A user can filter through the assigned/submitted leads by the use of check boxes
